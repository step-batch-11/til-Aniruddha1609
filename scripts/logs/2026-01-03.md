# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- Today I dive into promises more deeply to gain a deeper knowledge on that
  topic, how parallelization , serialization , async, await works in a deeper
  level and their flow of working.

- What changed in your understanding?

- Now I am more clear how promises work in a deeper level and I got an
  understanding of their flow and also get to know about some of the P5
  functions such as setup, draw, circle, rect, ellipse, line, translate etc.

- What would you explain differently now? I can explain how promises works in a
  deeper level and what are their flow of execution .

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
- I am still confused about how static shapes and dynamic shapes are created in
  P5 and how translate works.

- What would you like to see one more example of?
- I want to see more examples of working of P5 like how shapes can be created in
  a static and dynamic manner how they can be translate can be move from one
  position to another position and what are the mathematics are behind them .

- What feels fragile in your understanding? I feel fragile about my
  understanding of P5 workflow how different objects get created how we can
  apply different fucntions them to make it dynamic.

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- How static and dynamic objects can be created ?
- How can we apply translate or any differnt fucntion on a shape to make it move
  ?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- I want to make a firefly effect using P5
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because I got to know about workflow of Promises and Now I am
> super clear on that topic and also got to know little bit about P5 fucntions.
