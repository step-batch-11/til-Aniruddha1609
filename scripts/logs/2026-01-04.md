# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today? Today I make two animations using P5 and now I am
  clearer on P5 and how things works and also clearer about co-ordinates and how
  we can make shapes move to create an effect.
- What changed in your understanding? My understanding about co-ordinates and
  movement of shapes means how we can make a shape move or how to create an
  effect using P5.
- What would you explain differently now? I can explain about co-ordinate system
  and little bit about some P5 inbuilt functions.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?

- What would you like to see one more example of? I want to see one more exapmle
  of creation of different effects on screen and animation using P5.

- What feels fragile in your understanding?

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- How we can do clean code to make animations or effects?
- How to use classes and objects in animation and how they are helpful?
- How can we use any time function in P5 ?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- Some more animation using P% and want to learn about more inbuild function of
  P5.
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> of P5 and also about co-ordinate system.
